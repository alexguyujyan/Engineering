    <p>9/2/2022 - This week, we went on Tinkercad. We learned basic shapes. We also continued with coding.
    <p>9/16 - This week we began on our rube goldberg project on tinkercad </p>
    <p>9/23 - This week we are now building our rube goldberg machine</p>
    <p>9/30 - This week we are completing our rube goldberg machine</p>
    <p>10/3 - This week we began on bioengineering</p>
    <p> 10/10 - This week we are cadding a rocket we are making</p>
    <p> 10/21 - This week we are making the rockets</p>
    <p> 11/1 - This week we began on electrical engineering</p>
    <p> 11/8 - This week we started doing hands on activities</p>
    <p> 11/16 - This week we started using Arduino</p>
    <p> 11/25 - This week we started building our bridges.</p>
    <p> 12/2 -This week we desided to change our bridge design.</p>
    <p> 12-9 - This week we tested our bridges</p>
    <p> 12-16 - This week we finished up our bridges</p>
    <p> 01/11 - This week we started learning about buisness engineering.</p>
    <p> 01/18 - This week we started learning about chemical engineering.</p>
    <p> 03/03 - This week we tested our mousetrap cars, Martin and I did pretty
    good. Even though the final result was okay, the process was a little shaky. 
    At first, we slacked off a little, and we were just messing around. Then, 
    we started on our car, and things were going good until near the end, where 
    we discovered problems iwth our car. Due to this, we had to make a new one.
    In the last go, Martin and I locked in and just finished our project in 
    time, which was very nice. And the test, was also nice.</p>
    <p> 03/09 - This week we made a boat,then we saw how far it would go in a
    little stream of water. We used materials like balloons, cups, and more to 
    craft our boat. Then, we went outside and tested them, and our group of 
    four (Me, Martin, Preston, Josh) did very good, and our boat traveled
    a whopping 78 inches. </p>
